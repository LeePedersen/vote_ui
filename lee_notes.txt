Lee's notes

* session_store.rb not doing anything right now
* sucker_punch gem for asynchronous background jobs probably not the best for high-load applications

Working

* user auth
* each user session now unique
* throttling - for ddos and brute-force password attacks
* better email verification

To do?

* automatic timeout
* no need to refresh for new messages
* handle weird exceptions
